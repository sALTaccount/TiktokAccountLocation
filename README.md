# TikTok Account Location Finder

TikTok by default and with no way to turn it off, has your region publicly displayed on your profile!
The region is derived from your sim card, making it impossible to hide your location via a VPN or other means.

This is a proof of concept script that allows anyone to query this information for any TikTok user.

## Usage

```bash
python3 tiktok_location.py <username>
```
